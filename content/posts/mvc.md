<!-- intro -->

Today, modern web applications use some flavor of the
[MVC pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
with the aid of a
[client-side framework](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Introduction).
Having missed the pre-frontend framework era, I asked myself if I _really_
understood this foundational pattern? To answer this question, I decided to
build an app that adhered to the basic premise of MVC. This article discusses
key points of my implementation.

- View the [source code](https://github.com/dtjv/mvc.ts).

## MVC Basics

The MVC pattern describes a way to split an application into areas of concern
and how these areas relate to each other. The areas of concern include the data
Model, the View and the Controller.

### Model

The Model represents the application data and the functionality to manage that
data. It maintains data integrity by ensuring data creation and modification
abide by the application rules. The Model is unaware of any other component in
the system.

### View

The View provides a visual representation of the application data. To a degree,
the View must know about the Model. To what degree this knowledge exists depends
on the flavor of the MVC pattern used.

### Controller

In the _traditional_ version, the Controller encapsulates all business logic and
orchestrates communication between the Model, the View and any other components
added to the mix. Altnernative implementations of the MVC pattern diminish the
Controller's role and off-loading functionality to other components.

## Questions

The high-level descriptions in the previous section lack clarity on real world
implementation details. As I began to sketch out a rough design for my app, the
following questions came to mind.

- How does the application start?
- Who retrieves initial data?
- How does data get into the Model?
- How does the View get access to data?
- How does user interaction change the Model data?
- Should the View handle user interaction?
- Should the View update the Model?
- Should the Model persist data?
- What is the difference between the Model and application state?

For these implementational details, there are no definitive right or wrong
answers. I realized I needed to choose a direction and build.

## Version 1

In this first version of my todo app, I pass instances of the View, Model and
Store _(yes, a new component - disccussed below)_ components into the
Controller. The Controller manages data retrieval, data persistence, and
communication between components.

Below shows the application construction.

```typescript:title=index.ts
const view = new View(window.document, '#app') // View
const todos = new Todos() // Model
const store = new Store('todos1', localStorage) // Store
const app = new App(todos, view, store) // Controller

app.show()
```

### Model

In this version, a Todo is a type definition - not a class. The Todos _(note the
plural 's')_ class is the application Model and is dead simple, focusing on
creating and managing the in-memory storage of all Todo objects.

### View

The View renders all Todo objects that are in memory. The View knows about the
Model structure - that is, it knows the Todo properties to render, but it
doesn't communicate to or change the Model. When a user performs an action, the
View executes registered event handlers associated with that user action. Those
handlers are Controller methods.

### Controller

Again, the Controller orchestrates the app's activities. For example, the code
snippet below is a Controller event handler that executes when a user clicks on
the `Add Task` button and triggers the View to emit an event to create a todo.

```typescript:title=app.ts
export class App {
  //...

  // 1. tell Model to create and insert a new Todo
  // 2. persist the Model
  // 3. message the View to update
  handleCreateTodo(props: Partial<Todo>): void {
    if (props.task) {
      this.todos.insert({ task: props.task })
      this.save()
      this.show()
    }
  }

  //...
}
```

To keep the View decoupled from the Controller, all registered handlers for View
events must have the same generalized function signature. (See below).

```typescript:title=view.ts
export type Handler = (props: Partial<Todo>, event?: Event) => void
```

### Store

I also introduce a separate component responsible for data persistence. This
design isolates the implementational details of a specific storage system. The
code snippet below shows the Store class implemented for
[`Window.localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).

```typescript:title=store.ts
export class Store {
  constructor(private readonly key: string, private readonly db: Storage) {}

  get(): unknown[] {
    return JSON.parse(this.db.getItem(this.key) ?? '[]')
  }

  set(data: unknown[]): void {
    this.db.setItem(this.key, JSON.stringify(data))
  }
}
```

In the current design, the Controller makes calls directly to the Store to save
and retrieve data. You'll notice the Store retrieves **all** the data into
memory at once. This begs the question _"What happens when the data amount
exceeds memory capacity or exceeds storage limits?"_

One solution could be to use pagination and store the data across key indices
(assuming the storage limit was per key and not the whole database).

In the event the app exceeded the whole storage limit, I'd need to write a new
Store class that used a different database **and** change the Controller based
on how I built the Store. The need to swap data stores is not out of the
ordinary, but requiring other code to change to make the swap is not a great
design. To ease this transition, the Store and the Controller should communicate
by a contract defined by an interface. As it stands right now, the Controller
and the Store are too tightly coupled - a limitation I'll need to fix at another
time.

## Version 2

In version 2, the application construction remains the same as version 1 - save
for one small change to the View constructor. I'll discuss all the underlying
changes next.

### Emitter

First, I introduce an Emitter class that gives a subclass the ability to call
functions listening to any event that subclass emits.

```typescript:title=emitter.ts
export abstract class Emitter {
  private readonly listeners: Map<string, Listener[]> = new Map()

  addListener(event: string, listener: Listener): void {
    const listeners = this.listeners.get(event) ?? []
    listeners.push(listener)
    this.listeners.set(event, listeners)
  }

  emit(event: string): void {
    const listeners = this.listeners.get(event) ?? []
    listeners.forEach((listener) => {
      listener()
    })
  }
}
```

### Models

The Models are more robust in this version. A Todo is now a class implementation
that encapsulates Todo construction and modifications. The Todos _(note the
plural 's')_, class manages the collection of all Todo instances. Both classes,
collectively called the Model, subclass Emitter and emit a `CHANGE` event when
their internal data change.

The snippet below illustrates the Model event system. Here, the Todo exposes a
`toggle()` method to change the internal state of a Todo. Once changed, the Todo
will execute all functions listening on the `CHANGE` event.

```typescript:title=emitter.ts
export class Todo extends Emitter {
  private _done: boolean

  // 1. flip the `_done` property
  // 2. call listeners function registered to the `CHANGE` event
  public toggle() {
    this._done = !this._done
    this.emit(TodoEvents.CHANGE)
  }
}
```

### View

The View is now injected with the Model at application start-up. User
interaction captured by the View triggers the View to update the Model. With the
Model event system in place, any Model change will trigger listener functions to
run.

### Controller

In this version, the Controller is simple and limited to application setup, data
persistence and messaging the view. Below is the entire Controller class.

```typescript:title=app.ts
export class App {
  constructor(
    private readonly _todos: Todos,
    private readonly _view: View,
    private readonly _store: Store
  ) {
    // setup:
    // 1. load data into the Model
    // 2. register a function to run when the Model changes
    this.load()
    this._todos.addListener(TodoEvents.CHANGE, this._onChange.bind(this))
  }

  public load() {
    this._store.get().forEach((todo) => {
      this._todos.insert(new Todo(todo as Todo))
    })
  }

  public show() {
    this._view.render()
  }

  private _save() {
    this._store.set(this._todos.toJSON())
  }

  // called when the Model changes:
  // 1. save the Model
  // 2. update the View
  private _onChange() {
    this._save()
    this.show()
  }
}
```

## Final Thoughts

The high-level concept of MVC is easy to grasp and can indeed be trivially
implemented. Although the Todo MVC app is now a clich√©, this project was a great
exercise in exploring the nuances of the MVC pattern, in making design decisions
in the face of uncertainty and building with TypeScript and the DOM.
