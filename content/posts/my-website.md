For years I've had my own reserved spot on the internet - my domain. I taught
myself Jekyll and deployed a blogging website to GitHub Pages. And yet I never
published one article. This website is the third iteration, but the first one
I'll actually use - and here's why.

## Contribution

I have relied on community resources such as forum posts, comments, YouTube
videos, and blog posts, to help me solve software development obstacles. I find
these free resources indespensible. Of course, not everything out there is a
gold nugget, and there's a fair amount of sifting needed to find what one is
looking for.

Having benefited from the communities generosity, I want to give back.

## Understanding

I've gained the perspective that writing helps one to clarify thoughts, ideas
and beliefs. And writings geared to teach or explain soldify the author's own
understand - possibly revealing knowledge gaps along the way.

The other day I posed a basic technical questions to myself. I stammered to
answer and I realized, if I cannot explain what I think I know, then I don't
know it. Humbling.

## Writing

I want to be a better writer. Writing is a skill and like any skill if you want
to be good - well, rite more often. Sounds easy enough, right?

## Final Thought

I am excited at the thought of having a place to share my thoughts. I hope that
at least a bit of it will help others - in whatever way they need.

I'm more keen to write short bits than long-form tutorials. But I'm not going to
limit myself. Let me get this first post published and go from there.
