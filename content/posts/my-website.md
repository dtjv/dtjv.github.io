For years I've had a reserved spot on the internet - my own domain. I built my
first blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and
[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). Then I redesigned the site, again and again. And
yet I never published one article. This is my new website - built using
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and
it's the first site I'll actually use. Here's why.

## Contribution

I've relied on community resources such as forum posts, comments, YouTube
videos, and blog posts, to help me solve all my programming challenges. I find
these free resources indespensible. Of course, not everything on the internet is
a gold nugget, and there's a fair amount of sifting needed to find what one is
looking for.

Having benefited from the community's generosity, I want to give back.

## Understanding

I've gained the perspective that writing helps clarify thoughts, ideas and
beliefs. And writing geared to teach or explain soldify the author's own
understanding - possibly revealing knowledge gaps along the way.

The other day I posed a basic technical questions to myself. I stammered to
answer and I realized, if I cannot explain what I think I know, then I don't
know it. Humbling.

## Writing

I want to be a better writer. Writing is a skill and like any skill if you want
to be good - well, write more often. Sounds easy enough, right?

## Final Thought

I am excited at the thought of having a place to share my thoughts and
experiences. I hope that at least a bit of it will help others - in whatever way
they need.

I'm more keen to write short bits than long-form tutorials. But I'm not going to
limit myself. Let me get this first post published and go from there.
