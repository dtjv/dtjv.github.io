In 2018, I built the website for BMI Fitness - my former employer. In late 2019
I rebuilt the site with a focus to simplify site navigation, improve loading
time and integrate a CMS. Built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), styled in
Sass and [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/), and using
[Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) for backend CMS.
