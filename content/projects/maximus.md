<!-- intro -->

During the _"shelter-in-place"_ order, my home workouts got real boring. So, I
set a daily goal: 10 exercises, 100 reps per exercise. Well, after a couple
weeks I found it difficult to see any trends in my execution. So, I built
[Maximus](https://maximus-dtjv.netlify.app) - a [React](https://reactjs.org/)
based web app with a focus on super easy tracking and a cool visual to see
trends of past workouts.
