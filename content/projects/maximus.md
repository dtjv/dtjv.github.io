Tracking all the details of a workout can be super tedious. During the COVID
lockdown, I was limited to bodyweight exercises only - which can quickly turn
boring if you don't have a specific goal.

So, I set a daily goal: 10 exercises, 100 reps per exercise. Well, some days I
did well and other days I missed. Nevertheless, I _still_ wanted to track trends
in my execution. My tracking practices were ugly and results were hard to
visualize - so, I built [Maximus](https://maximus-dtjv.netlify.app).

Now, I can quickly track workouts **and** visualize my efforts over the last 30
days.
