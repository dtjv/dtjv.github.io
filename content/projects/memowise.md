<!-- intro -->

Back in 2016, a group of us built a React/Redux based flashcard app. With newer
tech available, I decided to do a rewrite.
[Memowise](https://memowise.vercel.app) is my own version - built using Next.js,
Tailwind CSS and MongoDB Atlas. As of this latest release, Memowise scores ðŸ’¯
for all categories in Google's Lighthouse test! ðŸ‘Š

You can read about this project and lessons learned in my article,
_[Lessons from building Memowise](/lessons-from-building-memowise/)_.
