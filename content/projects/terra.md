<!-- intro -->

A local garden center's paper-based delivery schedule process is fraught with
mistakes - leading to poor service and frustration.

[Terra](https://terra-demo.vercel.app) is my web-based solution concept. The
dashboard shows a familiar calendar-by-day view of deliveries, provides
drag-n-drop functionality for quick schedule changes and uses a multi-step form
to reduce errors, minimize delivery times and improve service..

ðŸš§ _This project is a work-in-progress_. ðŸš§

Currently written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), using
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).
Drag-n-Drop is courtesy of
[React-DnD](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about), forms logic by
[React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) and API calls via
[React-Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/).
