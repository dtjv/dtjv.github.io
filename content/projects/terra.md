<!-- intro -->

A local garden center's paper-based process to schedule deliveries is fraught
with mistakes - leading to poor customer service, lost sales and high service
employee turnover.

[Terra](https://terra-demo.vercel.app/admin/delivery) is my web-based solution
to schedule and manage customer deliveries. The delivery dashboard provides a
custom form wizard to auto compute delivery duration and open time slots -
reducing data collection errors, eliminating double bookings and maximizing time
to deliver.

I built this project in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), using
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) and
[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas). The Drag-n-drop feature
uses [React-Dnd](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about).

This project is currently a _work-in-progress_.
