The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture lies at the foundation of modern
web applications. At it's core, the MVC pattern is an exercise in
_separation-of-concerns_; however, implementations of that core concept vary
greatly.

This project is a working demonstration of the MVC pattern - built in two
implementations, using vanilla TypeScript.

You can read about this project in my article,
_[My Todo MVC](https://dtjv.io/mvc/)_.
