I found [travelsalem.com](https://travelsalem.com) through a job posting that
wanted to improve the site's SEO and usage. The site scores low marks using
Google Lighthouse, offers a convoluted navigation experience and has bugs
([bug screenshots](https://github.com/dtjv/travelsalem.com/tree/main/screenshots)).

This project is my redesign concept - simplifying the presentation and
navigation. I chose to build the site using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for
it's static site generation and image optimization features.
