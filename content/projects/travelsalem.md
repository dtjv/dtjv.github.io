I found [travelsalem.com](https://travelsalem.com) through a job posting that
wanted to improve the site's SEO and usage. The site's Google Lighthouse scores
are low and the navigation is convoluted and repetitive. This project is my
redesign concept - simplifying the presentation and navigation. I choose to use
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for it's static generation and image optimization.
