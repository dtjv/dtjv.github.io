<!-- intro -->

I found [travelsalem.com](https://travelsalem.com) through a job posting that
wanted to improve the site's SEO and usage. I found the site error prone and
cumbersome to use and thought it could use a new design.

This project is my redesign concept. It simplifies the navigation, prioritizes
data presentation, and loads fast. I built this project using
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

You can read about my design choices in my article,
_[A Redesign of travelsalem.com](https://dtjv.io/a-redesign-of-travelsalem/)_.
