        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p class="light">Hello! My name is David Valles and I’m a personal trainer living in San Jose, Ca.</p>
        <h5><strong>Background</strong></h5>
        <p class="light">
          I grew up in Santa Cruz and lived a typical childhood - school and play. However, back then, <span style="font-style:italic;">“play”</span> was not computer based - it was <span style="font-style:italic;">“go outside an entertain yourself”</span>. So, it was my brother, my sister and I - riding our bikes, playing kickball with the dog, tending to our garden, raking leaves to jump in and really anything else to stay outside.
        </p>
        <p class="light">
          I was quite competitive at an early age, so my parents channled that energy into youth soccer. By middle school I’d moved on to track and field where I excelled at the 800m and mile.
        </p>
        <p class="light">
          In college I stayed active as a recreational runner and started lifting weights. A couple years into college I joined the cycling team and ended my first competitive season as Omnium Champion.
        </p>
        <h5><strong>Career</strong></h5>
        <p class="light">
          I worked at a desk job for about 7 years out of college. When the dot-com crash left me high and dry, I took the opportunity to try something new - personal training. It was my chance to share what I’d learned in my athletic career, a way to meet and interact with more people, as well as make a positive contribution to someone’s life. Almost 12 years later, I’m still at it!
        </p>
        <p class="light">
          I began my training career at Club One, Almaden Valley. Over the years, I would move up from Personal Trainer, to Specialized, then Master Trainer and finally to Fitness Director. Along the way, I’ve met with hundreds of people - performing orientations, private training, semi-private and small group training and occasionally leading large classes. Today, I train at two facilities - Forma Gym, Almaden Valley and BMI Fitness in Santa Clara. I do a bit of in-home training as well.

        <h2>Testimonials</h2>
        <blockquote>
          When I first met David over 8 years ago, my doctor had told me I had to lose weight or face serious medical issues.  Ever since that day, David has been my personal trainer.  He created workouts to help me lose over 75 pounds, has trained me through various athletic events (that I never thought I would do) and also helped rehab me through major knee surgery (a result of carrying too much weight for years).  He has spent countless hours reviewing meal plans and providing endless pep talks when I was ready to give up.  He teaches his clients how to develop healthy habits that lead to a healthy lifestyle.  It may sound cliche but he helped "save my life". The road to healthy living is not always easy and I know I had to put in the work but having a personal trainer like David in my corner is a key part to my health successes past, present and future.

        <blockquote>
          I have been training with David for over 5 years and I can’t recommend him enough! I started training with David because I was no longer getting results on my own. David introduced me to a whole new way of training and continues to come up with new and effective exercises that make me look forward to coming to the gym. I have learned so much from David as he is willing to share his expert knowledge of nutrition, body mechanics, and injury prevention. With David’s help I have achieved far more than I originally hoped for. I now feel like I have the knowledge to achieve results on my own, I am stronger, more motivated, I workout smarter, and I continually challenge myself. David is motivating and incredibly knowledgeable about all things fitness and nutrition. I would definitely recommend him to anyone, regardless of fitness level.
