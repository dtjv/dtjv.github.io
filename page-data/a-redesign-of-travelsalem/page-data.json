The\nwebsite design is arguably dated and navigation proved to be cumbersome with the\ncomplex menu system. Then I ran into bugs.</p>\n<p>It didn't take long to realize the site needed a modern design. As a personal\nchallenge, I built a one-page demo to address the issues I experienced and\nperhaps sparks ideas about how to best improve the utility of the website. This\narticle explains my design decisions.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<h2>Goals</h2>\n<p>The job posting wanted someone to support, manage and grow the website. The\nspecific requirements that caught my attention were to improve SEO and grow the\nuser base.</p>\n<p>I ran the website through Google Lighthouse to get a baseline of how the site\nmeasured up. The scores were pretty low and in particular, the performance was\naround 8%. Is Google Lighthouse the definitive test? Perhaps not, but\n<a href=\"https://travelsalem.com\">travelsalem.com</a> is a content heavy website, not a\nrealtime, dynamic web app. It should perform much better.</p>\n<p>From the project outset, my goal was to achieve perfect Google Lighthouse\nscores. I chose to build the demo using <a href=\"https://nextjs.org\">Next.js</a>, primarily\nfor static site generation and image optimization. I used\n<a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com\">Tailwind CSS</a> to style the website.</p>\n<h2>Design</h2>\n<h3>Navigation</h3>\n<p>The current site's navigation is two drop-down menus and a traditional flat\nmenubar. One of the drop-down menus is often repeated in expanded form at the\ntop of visited pages. The other drop-down menu is a complex system of up to\nthree levels deep and, at times renders off page with no way to access the\nhidden menu items.</p>\n<p>From a usability perspective, navigating multi-level drop-downs risks irritating\nusers when their cursor slips off the menu system, sending them back to square\none. I feel, the whole point of content based websites is to present the\ncontent, not hide it away in a menu. My design eliminates all drop-down menus.</p>\n<h3>Data</h3>\n<p>To increase the site's utility is to provide easy access to pertinent data with\nthe fewest clicks. My design moves all the high level menu categories onto the\npage and presents this information in a more visually appealing and engaging\nway.</p>\n<p>For local businesses looking for exposure via\n<a href=\"https://travelsalem.com\">travelsalem.com</a>, my design displays all business\ninformation directly on the main page, categorized by industry. There's no need\nto search or drill down a menu system to locate a plumber or florist.</p>\n<h3>Sitemap</h3>\n<p>I added a proper footer that provides a simple and clear directory to site\ncontent and Travel Salem's company information. The directory proved simple\nenough to include it as the menu for mobile devices - and it vertically scrolls.</p>\n<h2>Final Thought</h2>\n<p>This project was fun and offered challenges I'd not experienced before - such as\nhorizontal scrolling, tabbed based UI components and image optimization\ntechniques beyond what <a href=\"https://nextjs.org\">Next.js</a> offered.</p>\n<p>One of the biggests time-sinks was dealing with image optimization. Google\nLighthouse often reported incorrect sizing errors, or inaccessible overlay text,\nor a too high image request count. I think I found the right balance of images,\nSVGs and plain text.</p>\n<p>And the Google Lighthouse scores? Not bad.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 768px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/f542278d5c3b039ec2d25775ff227f1d/136a2/2021-01-25-lighthouse.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 55.208333333333336%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAYAAAB/Ca1DAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAACC0lEQVQoz5VSXW/TQBD0D4CmSdrYsc++D9tnk8Sxm4RLYqeYAFJBiEoIBDz0AfH//8Owd6FtXnlY+eZ2bnZ2195gMMBkMsF4PMY0DHF1fYXRaIQgCHBBOc/z/i983yehKQI/QDQJMJ34TiwkcX98jeGLAYbD4SkGlydsvxZfUrwkfPHM8aRSkFxA5ini2wq8KU6YgpsZRFchTVOkUkHNC4hjAzXTDqdZCnFYQpo5UqEczxNCQEgB9vEG8ZcNom8GvEyRkBj7ahD93IEdlxAJR/jdgN1vENKdxfaeET/6sUO8peIsIYfkROQKjMSSzxuwX3vwSiPuLXmL6PcB7NMKQkmEDx1iKhL+uSUT0t0zEo8eWsTvasiIBG1CUjW+fuVcsjcVhC2SKUTva7APDfg8h4w54v0c0V2DhNxY7Arf3SAhMcuX1K3HOYcuNLrdHtvdDod9i6qqUFdLHNoOfd9j+5rGQORFOUP/tkeZa4cFibZti6aukcQxJJlzM7SHLM+QZRlyrU9LoNB01jp3OUVLMMbgeDzCbI17Y7uzbxRx7R6kIEGXsNXOgtOddS4ER8LtmTiELddu04qf8s9vHnWeHD5W1FRtQ45W6xVmixrtcorDRsPsO8yLEiGdF+sGHY2maRqcv3ctPwH3+5AD+i+Lf+1mWU7zEih1iqIskaUZZEFjoZmXhO14zsVs/AXr1jbR09uXjgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"pic\"\n        title=\"pic\"\n        src=\"/static/f542278d5c3b039ec2d25775ff227f1d/e5715/2021-01-25-lighthouse.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/f542278d5c3b039ec2d25775ff227f1d/8514f/2021-01-25-lighthouse.png 192w,\n/static/f542278d5c3b039ec2d25775ff227f1d/804b2/2021-01-25-lighthouse.png 384w,\n/static/f542278d5c3b039ec2d25775ff227f1d/e5715/2021-01-25-lighthouse.png 768w,\n/static/f542278d5c3b039ec2d25775ff227f1d/136a2/2021-01-25-lighthouse.png 884w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>","fields":{"slug":"/a-redesign-of-travelsalem/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Redesign of travelsalem.com","description":"Notes about redesign of travelsalem.com","date":"January 25, 2021"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"David Valles","siteUrl":"https://dtjv.io"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1667cbf8-c429-5024-a75b-050e57fb834e"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3764592887"]}
