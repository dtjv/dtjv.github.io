I built my\nfirst blog using <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> and\n<a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/\">Sass</a>. Then I redesigned the site, again and again. And\nyet I never published one article. This is my new website - built using\n<a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a> and <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">Tailwind CSS</a>, and\nit's the first site I'll actually use. Here's why.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<h2>Contribution</h2>\n<p>I've relied on community resources such as forum posts, comments, YouTube\nvideos, and blog posts, to help me solve all my programming challenges. I find\nthese free resources indespensible. Of course, not everything on the internet is\na gold nugget, and there's a fair amount of sifting needed to find what one is\nlooking for.</p>\n<p>Having benefited from the community's generosity, I want to give back.</p>\n<h2>Understanding</h2>\n<p>I've gained the perspective that writing helps clarify thoughts, ideas and\nbeliefs. And writing geared to teach or explain soldify the author's own\nunderstanding - possibly revealing knowledge gaps along the way.</p>\n<p>The other day I posed a basic technical questions to myself. I stammered to\nanswer and I realized, if I cannot explain what I think I know, then I don't\nknow it. Humbling.</p>\n<h2>Writing</h2>\n<p>I want to be a better writer. Writing is a skill and like any skill if you want\nto be good - well, write more often. Sounds easy enough, right?</p>\n<h2>Final Thought</h2>\n<p>I am excited at the thought of having a place to share my thoughts and\nexperiences. I hope that at least a bit of it will help others - in whatever way\nthey need.</p>\n<p>I'm more keen to write short bits than long-form tutorials. But I'm not going to\nlimit myself. Let me get this first post published and go from there.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/my-website/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My Website","description":"My own website.","date":"January 09, 2021"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"David Valles","siteUrl":"https://dtjv.io"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ac99be3e-dcd9-5985-bcb3-86177daefd01"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3764592887"]}
