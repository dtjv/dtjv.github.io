<p><strong>Hello!</strong> My name is David Valles and I'm a personal trainer living in San Jose, Ca.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I grew up in Santa Cruz and lived a typical childhood - school and play. However, back then, "play" was not computer based - it was <span style="font-style:italic;">"go outside an entertain yourself"</span>. So, it was my brother, my sister and I - riding out bikes, playing kickball with the dog, tending to our garden, raking leaves to jump in and really anything else to stay outside.</p>

<p>I was quite competitive at an early age, so my parents channled that energy into youth soccer. By middle school I'd moved on to track and field where I excelled at the 800m and mile.</p>

<p>In college I stayed active as a recreational runner and started lifting weights. A couple years into college I joined the a cycling team and ended my first competitive season as Omnium Champion.</p>

<h2>Career</h2>

<p>I worked at a desk job for about 7 years out of college. When the dot-com crash left me high and dry, I took the opportunity to try something new - personal training. It was my chance to share what I'd learned in my athletic career, a way to meet and interact with more people and hopefully make a positive contribution to someone's life. Almost 12 years later, I'm still at it!</p>

<p>I began my training career at Club One, Almaden Valley. Over the years, I would move up from Personal Trainer, to Specialized, then Master Trainer and finally to Fitness Director. Along the way, I've met with hundreds of people - performing orientations, private training, semi-private and small group training and occasionally in a large class setting. Today, I train at 2 facilities - Forma Gym, Almaden Valley and BMI Fitness in Santa Clara. I do a bit of in-home training as well.</p>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Be active everyday. Learn to move your body well. Enjoy a fitness foundation that supports your daily activities, sport endeavors and any physicaly challenge your heart desires. Be happy!</span></p>

<p>I aim to encourage, motivate, support and guide my clients to reach <span style="font-style: italic;">their</span> health and fitness goals through safe, progessive and - of course - <strong>fun</strong> training sessions. </p>
