**Hello!** My name is David Valles and I'm a personal trainer living in San Jose, Ca.

## Background

I grew up in Santa Cruz and lived a typical childhood - school and play. However, back then, "play" was not computer based - it was *"go outside an entertain yourself"*. So, it was my brother, my sister and I - riding our bikes, playing kickball with the dog, tending to our garden, raking leaves to jump in and really anything else to stay outside.

I was quite competitive at an early age, so my parents channled that energy into youth soccer. By middle school I'd moved on to track and field where I excelled at the 800m and mile.

In college I stayed active as a recreational runner and started lifting weights. A couple years into college I joined the cycling team and ended my first competitive season as Omnium Champion.

## Career

I worked at a desk job for about 7 years out of college. When the dot-com crash left me high and dry, I took the opportunity to try something new - personal training. It was my chance to share what I'd learned in my athletic career, a way to meet and interact with more people, as well as make a positive contribution to someone's life. Almost 12 years later, I'm still at it!

I began my training career at Club One, Almaden Valley. Over the years, I would move up from Personal Trainer, to Specialized, then Master Trainer and finally to Fitness Director. Along the way, I've met with hundreds of people - performing orientations, private training, semi-private and small group training and occasionally leading large classes. Today, I train at two facilities - Forma Gym, Almaden Valley and BMI Fitness in Santa Clara. I do a bit of in-home training as well.
